# MyBinaryTree
Exercise related with Trees and Graphs.

## Exercise Challenge
Here I implemented my own version of a Binary Tree.
I installed it using maven in my local machine, so I can use this class to solve other exercises.
If I set this project as a dependency in another projects, I can use this Binary Tree as if it was my own library.
